# Ken Carbaugh
## VCU Senior Project in Business Information Systems

The professor for this class encouraged everyone to code the project using MS Visual Basic since he was familiar with it. However, I chose to code using Python and Django. This was an interesting project made even more interesting by the fact that I was the only student who went off book on the development language.

Project web app:  [./mysite/hort/](https://github.com/kencarb/vcu-senior-project/tree/master/mysite/hort)

Considerations:
* The "project" is code and test data only
* For development, [Setup a virtualenv for Python 3 on Windows](http://timmyreilly.azurewebsites.net/setup-a-virtualenv-for-python-3-on-windows/)
* For data, [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) was sufficient
